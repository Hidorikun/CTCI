Problems solved while reading [Cracking the coding interview](https://inspirit.net.in/books/placements/Cracking%20the%20Coding%20Interview.pdf).

# NOTE
compile & run with: 
```
g++ -std=c++11 main.cpp -o main.exe && ./main.exe
```

if the following error occurs to you : 
>The procedure entry point \_gxx_personality_v0 could not be located in the dynamic link library

put __libstdc++-6.dll__ in the same folder as __main.exe__
